        Communication between HTML, CSS and Js - DOM (Document Object Modelling)
        SO this info helps us to send infor btw this 3 languages becs the whole idea is u use html css to design and u use js to
        compose ur logic and administer anything u want to do that invol communication with other websites
        Now we need to merge these 2 together to have a fully functional website

        How do we send infor from html to js:
        The use of events. Events are what helps us to send info to js. SOme of the events includes (onClick, mouseOver, focus, drag, drop,
        onChange ie onclicking a checkbox, calendar, radio button)
        So html to js communication is basically trigerring events.

        Now waht about Js to html communication:
        We can use either the Element Id, Class Name, Element Name
        And now since i can connect my js to html using the element Id, it means once i gain access to this element, i can do anything i want with that element.
        I can change the font, contents, style, and all.

        Once we are able to learn the 2 together, reactjs will be easier bcos reactJs embeds the 2 together as one and not them separated.
        In DOM modelling these 2 are separated but in reactJs they are together.

        WAY TO DISPLAY OUTPUT RESULT:
        console, alert, html
